##### Homework due for today (Oct 8 2013)

1. Look back at <%= link_to_lecture :ideation %>. I have updated it to properly mark the required deliverables.
	* <%= deliverable "Hand in any deliverables that you overlooked" %>
1. Update the grid of product ideas with your "numbers" from the last class
	* Each student adds 3 columns to the spreadsheet. 
	* Columns named with your initial
	* So for me they would be PS Wants, PS Big Idea, PS Tech
	* And record the numbers from your notes.
	* Don't change because you see other people's numbers!
1. Meet outside class for 1-2 hours with 2 other students of your chosing
	* Check out: [Term Project Grid](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlOy9HFaILD6dGp0UndEd0tMOTNOTXlQY2RqOElTZlE&usp=drive_web#gid=0)
	* Review your favorite term product ideas
	* Add your name (if you want) to the "Put your name here if you could see working on this project" column
	* If you are the "promoter" of the idea, update your level of excitement.
	* If you feel you are more excited about an idea than the promoter, convince the promoter that you should take over as promoter :)
	* <%= deliverable "Update the Term project Grid based on the discussion." %>

##### Topics

* Speed Dating
	* Free for all
	* Small group converstations trying to select ourselves into teams
	* Teams will consist of 3 students
