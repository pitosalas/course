##### Homework due for today

1. Update the grid of product ideas with your "numbers" from the last class
	* Each student adds 3 columns to the spreadsheet. 
	* Columns named with your initial
	* So for me they would be PS Wants, PS Big Idea, PS Tech
	* And record the numbers from your notes.
	* Don't change because you see other people's numbers!
1. Meet outside class for 1-2 hours with 2 other students of your chosing
	* Review your favorite term product ideas
	* Add your name (if you want) to the "Put your name here if you could see working on this project" column
	* If you are the "promoter" of the idea, update your level of excitement. If you feel you are more excited about an idea than the promoter, convince the promoter that you should take over as promoter :)
1. Each student prepares at least one product concept at a high level. 
	* <%= deliverable "Be ready to describe your favorite product concept in 2 minutes." %>
