##### Homework due for today

1. Read and come with questions about how the term projects will work.
	* <%= link_to_incubator :term_project_framework %>
	* <%= link_to_incubator :term_project_how_to%>
	* <%= link_to_incubator :final_deliverables %>

2. Here is the grid of term project ideas so far: [Term Projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlOy9HFaILD6dGp0UndEd0tMOTNOTXlQY2RqOElTZlE&usp=drive_web#gid=0)
	* Review it, try to make sure you understand what each product idea is
	* Update the ones that are yours: you may change the name, your degree of excitement, the tweet length description.
	* If you have come up with some more ideas that are good, you may add them to the grid as well as post a project brief for them.

3. Watch 2 episodes of ["Shark Tank"](http://watchabc.go.com/shark-tank/SH559076/VDKA0_10b7czs1/week-2), a TV show about fake venture capitalists, and write a blog post with some reactions and reflections. How did the show make you feel? What surprised you? Did it change your mind? 

##### B-R-A-I-N-S-T-O-R-M

Up to now, you've been thinking about what product you want to pursue for the balance of the term. Today and the next class we will be going through everyone's ideas and trying to improve, refine and define them further to reach a point where we have about 10 good ideas.
