##### Homework due for today (Oct 4 2013)


1. **Note: there is still time to add new term project ideas! Create a quick product brief and add it to the table**
	* Here is the grid of term project ideas so far: [Term Projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlOy9HFaILD6dGp0UndEd0tMOTNOTXlQY2RqOElTZlE&usp=drive_web#gid=0)
	* Look at all the materials and see if any new idea comes to mind
	<%= deliverable "Add your new idea to the term project ideas" %>

2. Read and come with questions about how the term projects will work.
	* <%= link_to_incubator :term_project_framework %>
	* <%= link_to_incubator :term_project_how_to%>
	* <%= link_to_incubator :final_deliverables %>
	* *Prepare for class discussion!*

3. Look at [Term Project Ideas So Far](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlOy9HFaILD6dGp0UndEd0tMOTNOTXlQY2RqOElTZlE&usp=drive_web#gid=0)
	* Review it, try to make sure you understand what each product idea is
	* Update the ones that are yours: you may change the name, your degree of excitement, the tweet length description.
	<%= deliverable "Apply any updates that you come up with" %>

3. Watch 1 episode of ["Shark Tank"](http://watchabc.go.com/shark-tank/SH559076/VDKA0_10b7czs1/week-2), a TV show about fake venture capitalists.
	* <%= deliverable "Write a blog post with some reactions and reflections. How did the show make you feel? What surprised you? Did it change your mind?"%>

##### B-R-A-I-N-S-T-O-R-M

Up to now, you've been thinking about what product you want to pursue for the balance of the term. Today and the next class we will be going through everyone's ideas and trying to improve, refine and define them further to reach a point where we have about 10 good ideas.

* Let's go through the top rated term project ideas.
	* If it's your proposal, then feel free to adjust the name, "how excited", and high level description of each one as we talk
	* If it's not yours, then feel free to add your name to "would like to work on this" list

* I will also go through some of the products off my list to see if I can generate interest in them

* As we do this, get a piece of paper and write down for each Term Product Idea 3 numbers:
	* Would I want to work on the team that builds it (1 = never never - 5=I can't wait to start)
	* Is this a 'big idea'? Think carefully: can you imagine that the product can be made to have a big and broad impact? E.g., not just at Brandeis, but across campuses around the world, or, not just among my friends, but for a million people? (1 = it will be used by 10^1 people, 5 = it might be used by 10^5 people or more)
	* Technical: How difficult will it be to actually implement this product or service? (1 = Really easy, could be done in a weekend, 5 = Really challenging, would require a large team or company to create.)
