##### Devises and appliances

* <%= discussion "Devices and appliances" %>
	* What do we mean here?
	* Examples: Nest, ...
	* What are the idenfitiable distinctions betweem a device and a mobile app?
	* What are the similarities?
	* How would you decide to make your product into an appiance vs. a mobile app?

* Considerations in deciding to deliver your app as an appliance
	* It might be the only way to do it
	* There are now real variable costs to delivery
	* Likely there will be certification issues
	* Much more difficult to upgrade functionality
	* Buyer much more likely to be willing to pay
	* But profit will be less.
