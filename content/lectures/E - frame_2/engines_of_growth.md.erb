##### Review

* Why metrics are important
* Vanity vs. Actionable metrics
	* The fact that I have more users today than I did last week doesn't mean that much
	* You need to know what you are trying to optimize for
	* Then you need to figure out what changes improve those variables
	* Only then can you tell if it's a good thing that you have more users today!
