##### Homework due for today (Nov 5 2013)

1. Read [A Summary of User Interface Design Principles](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sylvantech.com%2F~talin%2Fprojects%2Fui_design.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzfZLk-zyoMy1xkfGscZSCkj4jmQwg) and [Principles of User Interface Design](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbokardo.com%2Fprinciples-of-user-interface-design%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzdSLWzK-QmM1_v0_4qSOX5haifrEg). Note: you may add your favorite other article about UI and UX design. <%= deliverable "A blog post about one of the principles from these or your readings and how it applies to your product. Prepare for a classroom discussion" %>
1. Check out [Five Second Test](http://fivesecondtest.com) and choose an aspect of your product to test using this site. *Prepare to explain it in class!*
1. Read [Effective Use of whote space in forms](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-white-space). *(yes I just added this one because I just came across it.)*

* <%= include_topic :user_experience_basics %>

##### Let's look at some sites

* [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/)- Something you know well. Point out a few good and a few bad user interface elements. Have you ever tried to get someone (like a parent) to use Facebook? What worked and what did not?
* [Noteflight](http://www.noteflight.com/login) - Can you or can't you assume that the user is a musician, or knows music notation?

* Split into groups of 2, each pick a different one from below without checking what it is. Analyze and report back: What's good and/or bad about each one? Refer back to all the principles

	* [Site 2](http://hunch.com)
	* [Site 3](http://www.mapmyfitness.com)
	* [Site 4](http://www.amazon.com)
	* [Site 5](https://www.remind101.com)
	* [Site 6](http://www.feedbackarmy.com)
	* [Site 7](http://www.rememberthemilk.com)

##### Conclusion
* I want you to always refer back to principles such as these when you design or present a user experience. 
* It's very easy to say, "Oh it's common sense." But you submit designs that violate these principles left and right.
* It's important. Make it part of your toolkit. Internalize it! Take care!
