##### Homework due for today (Fri Nov 1)
* Blog post: how the internet works :)

	**N.B.** In this frame we are going to explore the technical architecture of your products. Key to all of them is how clients and servers connect to each other and why. 

	*This homework asks for a blog post explaining as best you can exactly what happens when you type http://www.google.com into your browser window and perform a search and get results displayed.*

	You should consider what happens inside your computer, inside your browser, inside the network, and inside other servers that might be involved. Using the web, wikipedia, google, investigate basic info about how http, tcp/ip, ip addresses and so on work.

	You should know that a complete answer to this question would take many pages. **I am not expecting that.** Explain enough that I can see that you've thought about it and researched it online.

	Here are some links that *might might* be useful: [Internet architecture](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/digitaldemocracy/internetarchitecture.html), [Wikipedia entry on "intenret"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet), [Wikipedia article on "HTTP"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web.)
