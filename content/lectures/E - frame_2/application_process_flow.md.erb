##### Homework due for today (Nov 8 2013)


*
##### Designing the User Experience
* Difference between UX and UI?
* What is good UX? Is it just a matter of opinion?

##### Looking at some existing products: 5-10 minute exercise
* Make some notes *about the user experience* for discussion after examining these two well known sites.
* Think about the UX and UI principles we've looked at
* Work independently but it's ok to look over each others shoulders :) 
	* [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) - Something you know well. Find a few good and a few bad user interface elements. Have you ever tried to get someone (like a parent) to use Facebook? What worked and what did not? What is the most confusing?
	* [Piazza](http://www.piazza.com) - Let's examine the UI and UX and think about your own use of Piazza. What are the top good and bad things about the user experience.



##### Excercise (experimental)
* Setting the timezone. On Mac, Windows, iPhone and Android
* 4 teams develop quick paper prototypes with UX flow
* Put each up on the board

##### Making a User Experience flow diagram: P2P Tours
