##### Homework due for today (Nov 8 2013)

* An affordance is some characteristic of an object that communicates how it is to be operated. 

	A keyhole in a lock tells me that I need a key and where to insert it. A handle on a fridge tells me how to pull it. A bottlecap on a bottle of beer tells me something. But does it tell me to use a bottle opener or just unscrew it? 

	With this context, look around your daily world (room, office, campus) for affordances everywere. Find and photograph a few examples where (visible) affordances were absent, or communicated the wrong thing. <%= deliverable "Post your photos to Piazza with commentary." %>
* Practice Paper Prototyping and developing a user experience flow chart.
	* Read this article: [Paper Prototyping](http://alistapart.com/article/paperprototyping).
	* Read this article: [7 Myths about Paper Prototyping](http://www.userfocus.co.uk/articles/paperprototyping.html).
	* Read this article: [How to create a UX flow chart](http://www.startuprocket.com/blog/how-to-create-a-user-experience-flow-chart-ux-flow-chart)

	With your team, develop a set of single screen paper prototypes connected by arrows that indicate when a user action or event leas to another screen or page. I refer to this as your application process flow. 

	Focus more on the connections between the screens than making super detailed screens. Use separate sheets of paper, one for each screen with indications of how you get to another screen. *I discourage you from using html or other tools because you are always better off doing a sketch on paper before going to any tools.* 

	<%= team_deliverable "Spend 1-2 hours as a team (with everyone!), divide up the work and come up with a process flow for your app. You don't need to do more than 10 pages. Tape them to a whiteboard, draw the lines on the board, and take a photograph. Also bring them to class."  %>

##### Designing the User Experience
* Difference between UX and UI?
* What is good UX? Is it just a matter of opinion?

##### Looking at some existing products: 5-10 minute exercise
* Make some notes *about the user experience* for discussion after examining these two well known sites.
* Think about the UX and UI principles we've looked at
* Work independently but it's ok to look over each others shoulders :) 
	* [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) - Something you know well. Find a few good and a few bad user interface elements. Have you ever tried to get someone (like a parent) to use Facebook? What worked and what did not? What is the most confusing?
	* [Piazza](http://www.piazza.com) - Let's examine the UI and UX and think about your own use of Piazza. What are the top good and bad things about the user experience.

##### Paper prototyping and related techniques
* Why I insist on 'paper prototyping'
* How ugly can it be?
* Fast iteration
* Role of the UX Flow Chart

##### Excercise (experimental)
* Setting the timezone. On Mac, Windows, iPhone and Android
* 4 teams develop quick paper prototypes with UX flow
* Put each up on the board

##### Making a User Experience flow diagram: P2P Tours
* Let's start with B2BTours (any of them)
	* What are the personas? How many are there?
	* If I am the end user whats the first thing I want to see?
	* What are the actions I need from that state?
	* Etc.
