##### Homework due for today (Nov 19 2013)


1. Combine what each team member did individually last time with the design of the data model. Include a clear indication of each table (==entitity), what columns (==attribute or property) each one has, what the relationship the tables have to each other (1-1, 1-many, many-1, many-many), and what the primary and foreign keys are. <%= team_deliverable "Generate a new, more detailed schema" %>

		Example format:
		
		Table: Course
		Attributes: ID, course_name, course_number
		
		Table: Student
		Attributes: ID, First_name, Last_name, Grad_year

		Table: Enrollment
		Attributes: ID, Student:ID, Course:ID

		Relationships:
		Student -> Enrollment is One to Many
		Course -> Enrollment is One to Many
		Course <-> Student is Many to Many

	Of course if you want to make a diagram, that's ok too.

1. Each team prepares an 8 minute presentation reviewing status for frame 2 of each of the goals for this frame. <%= team_deliverable "Place link to Google Docs presentation into shared course Google Drive folder." %>
