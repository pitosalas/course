##### Homework due for today (Nov 19 2013)


1. Combine what each team member did individually last time with the design of the data model. Include a clear indication of each table (==entitity), what columns (==attribute or property) each one has, what the relationship the tables have to each other (1-1, 1-many, many-1, many-many), and what the primary and foreign keys are. <%= team_deliverable "Generate a new, more detailed schema" %>

		Example format:
		
		Table: Course
		Attributes: ID, course_name, course_number
		
		Table: Student
		Attributes: ID, First_name, Last_name, Grad_year

		Table: Enrollment
		Attributes: ID, Student:ID, Course:ID

		Relationships:
		Student -> Enrollment is One to Many
		Course -> Enrollment is One to Many
		Course <-> Student is Many to Many

	Of course if you want to make a diagram, that's ok too.

1. Each team prepares an 10 minute presentation reviewing status for frame 2 of each of the goals for this frame. <%= team_deliverable "Place link to Google Docs presentation into shared course Google Drive folder." %>

##### Topics

* Presentations
	* Invited outside guest
	* 10 minutes a piece
	* Immediate feedback from class and instructor.

##### Frame 2 Presentation hints and tips. 
* This is directly from the  <%= link_to_incubator :term_project_framework %>
* Presentation should include:

	* A visual mockup or good paper prototype to use in further experiments and as input to the design.
	* A diagram showing the flow of screen to screen in the user interface and explanation thereof.
	* An architectural diagram of the product, site, app or service. An idea of how it could be built. What are the major building blocks or services.
	* Database schemas on the server and/or client as needed to support your product. Communcation/REST protocol outline for your product. What jobs does the server do for the clients.

		*NB: You need to continue to validate the product! Some products are too narrow and need to be broadened; some of them don't represent enough of a market; some of them have no significant demonstrated demand. Continued refinement of the stories explaining the functionality, and continued reflection on the hypotheses and whether more should be added and/or tested.*
* The team will deliver a 10 minute informative presentation summarizing the progress so far. 
	* Note that the presentation needs to be self-contained, in other words, it should include 	some of the context of Frame 1 to make it understandable and meaninful on its own.
	* Any diagrams, paper prototypes, and other illustrations need to be presented and explained so that the audience can understand and be engaged.
	* Rehearse/Practice!
		* Be familiar with the material so you don't umm and mumm as if you are seeing the material for the first time.
		* Keep in mind that no one has seen this presentation before, and at least one person in the audience has never heard of your project. 
		* A presentation is a kind of performance.
		* Keep to the time limit. Keep questions to the end.
