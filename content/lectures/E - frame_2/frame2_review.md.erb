##### Homework due for today (Nov 19 2013)


1. Combine what each team member did individually last time with the design of the data model. Include a clear indication of each table (==entitity), what columns (==attribute or property) each one has, what the relationship the tables have to each other (1-1, 1-many, many-1, many-many), and what the primary and foreign keys are. <%= team_deliverable "Generate a new, more detailed schema" %>

		Example format:
		
		Table: Course
		Attributes: ID, course_name, course_number
		
		Table: Student
		Attributes: ID, First_name, Last_name, Grad_year

		Table: Enrollment
		Attributes: ID, Student:ID, Course:ID

		Relationships:
		Student -> Enrollment is One to Many
		Course -> Enrollment is One to Many
		Course <-> Student is Many to Many

	Of course if you want to make a diagram, that's ok too.

1. Each team prepares an 10 minute presentation reviewing status for frame 2 of each of the goals for this frame. <%= team_deliverable "Place link to Google Docs presentation into shared course Google Drive folder." %>

##### Topics

* Presentations
	* Invited outside guest
	* 10 minutes a piece
	* Immediate feedback from class and instructor.

##### Frame 2 Presentation Content
* The team will deliver a 10 minute informative presentation summarizing the progress so far.
* This is directly from the  <%= link_to_incubator :term_project_framework %>
* Presentation should include:
	* A visual mockup or good paper prototype to use in further experiments and as input to the design.
	* A diagram showing the flow of screen to screen in the user interface and explanation thereof.
	* An architectural diagram of the product, site, app or service. An idea of how it could be built. What are the major building blocks or services.
	* Database schemas on the server and/or client as needed to support your product. Communcation/REST protocol outline for your product. What jobs does the server do for the clients.
	* Updated list of stories. Don't just show a big list. You need to organize them into sets of related functionality, sometimes called "epics", for the purposes of presentation. For example: 
		* "Core Proximity Functionality (4 Stories)"" or 
		* "Abilities to define ad-hoc survey for real time feedback (5 stories)" or 
		* "Visualize and change users visibility to other users (5 stories)" or 
		* "Animal shelter registration and profile updating (3 stories)".

	*NB: You need to continue to validate the product! Some products are too narrow and need to be broadened; some of them don't represent enough of a market; some of them have no significant demonstrated demand. If you are expecting an investor to give you money to continue this project, then you must continue to refinem the stories explaining the functionality, and continued reflection on the hypotheses and whether more should be added and/or tested.*
