##### Pricing Models
* My terminology
* A subset of the business model
* Explanation of who pays and what they pay for
* Ask yourself some questions:
	* Who is getting value out of this business?
	* Who is willing to pay for that value?
	* What exactly are they willing to pay for?
	* When are they most likely to be willing to pay for it?
	* How often are they willing to pay for it?
