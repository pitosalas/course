##### Homework due for today (Oct 11, 2013)

1. Teams meet for 2 hours outside class.
	* Create a folder for your team under the class Google Drive Folder.
	* Review <%= link_to_incubator :term_project_summary %>. Note this outline will grow as the class progresses. For now it's pretty simple. Write Term Project Summary as a Google doc and put it in your project google drive folder.
	* Discuss with your team which tracker you want to use: Trello or PivotalTracker for your to-do's and stories. Each product has its advantages. Maybe have one student demo Pivotal and the other demo Trello and decide between the two.
	* <%= team_deliverable "Put the Term Project Summary and the link to the Trello or Pivotal tracker project into your project folder." %>
1. Each team will be responsible for a brief progress report every week. In your team meeting you should decide who will take care of this, or, take turns. It will be a team deliverable. 
	* <%= team_deliverable "Write the first weekly progress report, and file it as progress_report in piazza." %>
