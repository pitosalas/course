##### Homework due for today (Oct 22 2013)

* Read [this article about about principles for a clean visual design](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.visualmess.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzful-D3sxjhshl5o_AlDsoz20YtvQ)
	* Select two of the principles and find two examples of web sites or mobile apps that VIOLATE those principles. <%= deliverable "2-5 paragraph blog post, with images, explaining the two principles in your own words, showing the examples that you found, and explaining why they violated the principles." %>
* Sketches of the two most important screens in your app
	* Work independently to see how different ideas come out!
	* Try to use some of the principles from the article above
	* Think about colors, placement of items, alignment, balance and so on. 
	* You can use any tool(s) you want - pencil and paper, watercolors, photoshop. 
	* Be neat and clear but you don't get extra credit for being super fancy
	* <%= deliverable "Piazza post with the two images. We will review them together in class." %>
* Peer feedback notes
	* <%= team_deliverable "A Piazza post divided into two sections. What feedback you gave the other team and what feedback you received." %>
* Term Project teams: Continue to work on your hypotheses.

##### Creating an MVP / Prototyping / Mockups
* Compare terms: MVP vs. prototype vs. mockup
* You need to be able to articulate exactly why you are creating a prototype
* Looks like vs. Works like
* Purpose of prototype dictates the medium and fidelity
* **Discussion:** for each product, what prototype/MVP should you be building now?
