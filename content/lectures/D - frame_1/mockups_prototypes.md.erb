##### Homework due for today
* Read [this article about about principles for a clean visual design](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.visualmess.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzful-D3sxjhshl5o_AlDsoz20YtvQ)
	* Select two of the principles and find two examples of web sites or mobile apps that VIOLATE those principles. <%= deliverable "2-5 paragraph blog post, with images, explaining the two principles in your own words, showing the examples that you found, and explaining why they violated the principles." %>
* Team assignment: 'comps' of two of your most important screens
	* A comp is an image of an app screen or web site which shows what it will look like, without having any functionality, usually for the purpose of showing it to a client. Use some of the basic principles above. Think about colors, placement of items, alignment, balance and so on. You can use any tool(s) you want - photoshop, illustrator, watercolors, pencil and paper. <%= deliverable "Individual links to each of the images posted to your blog. We will review them together in class." %>

##### Creating an MVP / Prototyping / Mockups
* Compare terms: MVP vs. prototype vs. mockup
* You need to be able to articulate exactly why you are creating a prototype
* Looks like vs. Works like
* Purpose of prototype dictates the medium and fidelity
* **Discussion:** for each product, what prototype/MVP should you be building now?
