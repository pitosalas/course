1. Read [A Summary of User Interface Design Principles](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sylvantech.com%2F~talin%2Fprojects%2Fui_design.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzfZLk-zyoMy1xkfGscZSCkj4jmQwg) and [Principles of User Interface Design](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbokardo.com%2Fprinciples-of-user-interface-design%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzdSLWzK-QmM1_v0_4qSOX5haifrEg). <%= deliverable "A blog post about one of the principles and how it applies to your product. Prepare for a classroom discussion" %>
1. <%= deliverable "two" %>

##### Take a look at these examples of User Experience

<%= carousel(%w(affordance1.jpg affordance2.jpg affordance3.jpg)) %>

* *Discussion:* In each case, can you see something wrong with the user interface? And while you are trying to answer the question, be introspective, and tell me your thought process. How are you trying to find the problem, if any?

##### Rules of thumb for good User Experience

* Pay attention to AFFORDANCES
	* I want to make you become aware of affordances all around you
	* Visual (or other clues) that something can be pushed, pulled, dragged, clicked, etc.
	* Without them user is lost
* Know the answer to the question: WHO IS MY USER?
	* "Personas". Note, often there is more than one.
	* Build on what users likely have seen before
	* Platform consistency (iPhone, Android ... but then compare with Flash. Is that a platform? How about web?) 
	* Conventions: back, home, undo, cut, paste, file menu, etc.
* Guide the USERS' CONCEPTUAL MODEL (sometimes called the user metaphor)
	* What this application is about - that sets expectations?
	* What the USER (see above) is 'expecting' right now?  What is she 'reaching for' right now?
	* Remember the importance of WORDS that match this metaphor and user expectations
* PROXIMITY Implies RELATIONSHIP
	* Put things that relate to each other near each other and vice versa
	* Pay attention to the Visual Hierarchy
	* Denote hierarchy/nesting of elements: posts->comments, projects->tasks, playlists->tracks, etc.
	* Use size (and type choice) consistently to communicate importance/role
	* Alignment and balance are important for aestheticse
* Don't user spend ANY mental energy on questions like this (see [book by Steve Krug](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321344758/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=0789723107&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=01JC0FH5XCJXVC5A2604))
	* Where am I?
	* Where should I begin?
	* Where did they put it?
	* What are the most important things on this screen?
	* Think about DISCOVERABILITY
	* <%= discussion "Lets look at each of the four products in this context" %>
* MOBILE is DIFFERENT
	* Assume mobile user is distracted, brief attention span
	* Does NOT think of device as a computer
	* Context: What is users mindset? Where are they, in a car, in line at store, at the theatre?

##### Let's look at some sites
* [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/)- Something you know well. Point out a few good and a few bad user interface elements. Have you ever tried to get someone (like a parent) to use Facebook? What worked and what did not?
* [Noteflight](http://www.noteflight.com/login) - Can you or can't you assume that the user is a musician, or knows music notation?

* Split into six groups, analyze and report back: What's good and/or bad about each one? Refer back to the principles
