1. Read: [Achieve product Market Fit](http://businessmodelalchemist.com/blog/2012/08/achieve-product-market-fit-with-our-brand-new-value-proposition-designer.html). *Prepare for an in class discussion!*
1. After reading the above article on your own, get together with your project team, spending 1-2 hours together
	* Review <%= link_to_incubator :term_project_summary %>.
	* *Everyone listen to each other: do you still agree with what's written in tweet-length description? Do you want to change it? Do you agree with the Product Summary? Do you want to change it. Aligment is important!*
	* Discuss and debate the "[Value Proposition Canvas](http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/downloads/value_proposition_canvas.pdf)" and how it applies to your project.
	* Add the corresponding section to your <%= link_to_incubator :term_project_summary %>.

1. Continue developing hypotheses and start testing them
	* All team members, as a team or indivudually should take on one or more hypotheses to test

*Note: we will cover lots of stuff in lectures which go beyond what the term projects require.*
