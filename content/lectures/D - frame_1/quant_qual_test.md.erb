##### Homework due for today (Oct 18 2013)

1. Linkedin Groups: Locate a linkedin group that might have useful feedback on some of your hypotheses. Compose an email question that you would send to them expecting an answer. *Prepare to explain it in class!*
1. Go out of the building! Each member of each product team should take some hypotheses off the list to test outside the building. <%= deliverable "Write a blog post describing the several hypotheses that you tested, how you did it and what the results were." %>
1. Get together with your project team, spending 1-2 hours together
	* Review <%= link_to_incubator :term_project_summary %>.
	* *Everyone listen to each other: do you still agree with what's written in tweet-length description? Do you want to change it? Do you agree with the Product Summary? Do you want to change it. Aligment is important!*
	* <%= team_deliverable "Update any part of your term project summary. Add the new sections as indicated." %>

##### Class Feedback Summary
* More outside speakers
* More focus on tools and techniques of Entrepreneurship
* Homework is sometimes a bit much (deliverables and/or reading)

##### Homework comments
* Why do we have both Piazza and Google Drive?
* No need anymore to post link to Latte
* Make very very very sure that the homework number (e.g. 12.1) is part of the name of the Piazza post or the document in the Google Drive folder.
* Remember on Project Summary
	* it should be a cohesive, readable document
	* it's a summary not a diary! 
	* have supplementary documents in your project folder.

##### Peer Feedback sessions
* Read the other team's project summary
* Have a discussion and constructive criticism
* Be open minded!
* Reviewee and reviewer teams: Listen carefully and take notes
* Consider:
		* Effort/Seriousness of purpose; How well is the team thinking in a Lean Startup way
		* How can their product be improved? How can it be made "bigger"? Try not to focus only on little details
* Pairs:
	* intelEvent <-> Attend.ly
	* What's going on <-> PetTo.me
* Take 30 minutes; maybe one group go to Vertical Lounge; 15 minute for each product.
* Homework for next class will be to write up what you said (to other team) and what you heard (from other team)

##### Hypotheses and testing

* <%= discussion "Hypotheses for your term products product" %>
	* Where are you keeping them? Give me the URL so we can all look at them
	* What are some characteristics of a well stated hypothesis?
	* Let's discuss "technology" hypotheses and their role at this stage
	* How exactly could we test it qualitatively?
	* How exactly could we test it quantitatively?
	* Repeat for some more hypotheses
