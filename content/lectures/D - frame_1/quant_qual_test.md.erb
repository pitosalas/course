##### Homework due for today (Oct 18 2013)

1. Linkedin Groups: Locate a linkedin group that might have useful feedback on some of your hypotheses. Compose an email question that you would send to them expecting an answer. *Prepare to explain it in class!*
1. Go out of the building! Each member of each product team should take some hypotheses off the list to test outside the building. <%= deliverable "Write a blog post describing the several hypotheses that you tested, how you did it and what the results were." %>
1. Get together with your project team, spending 1-2 hours together
	* Review <%= link_to_incubator :term_project_summary %>.
	* *Everyone listen to each other: do you still agree with what's written in tweet-length description? Do you want to change it? Do you agree with the Product Summary? Do you want to change it. Aligment is important!*
	* <%= team_deliverable "Update any part of your term project summary. Add the new sections as indicated." %>
