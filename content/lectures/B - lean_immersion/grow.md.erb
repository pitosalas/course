##### Homework due for today (Sept 27 2013)

1. Read 
	* "The Lean Startup", Chapter 8. *Prepare for class discussion!*
	* Review [Engine of Growth Example](http://bit.ly/growth_engine)
	* [Don't let the Minimum overcome the Viable](http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/05/dont_let_the_minimum_win_over.html). 
	* [Pivoting when using Lean Startup](http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/07/pivoting-product-development)
	* Chapter 8 of Lean Startup Book. 
	* *Prepare for class discussion!*

1. Meet with your Pilot team and discuss progress so far. What is your solution hypothesis so far? What kind of engine of growth do you think might work for the pilot product? 
	* <%= team_deliverable "Team blog post on your views and analysis of the engine of growth." %>
1. Same meeting: you should now have stated and tested one or more problem, customer and solution hypothesis. What hypotheses have been eliminated? Especially in the solution space, see if you can do a few more out of the building interviews (esp in person if feasible)
	* <%= team_deliverable "Update your 6.1 Deliverable based on this further work. You can rename the title to say 6.1/7.2" %>

1. Blog post in Piazza about your reactions and reflections on the Lean Startup technique. Please don't simply parrot what's in the book. Pause to think about what it has been to apply it so far. What are some key learnings? How would you explain it to a friend? What parts of it don't you think are valuable? <%= deliverable "Piazza post, 3 or 4 paragraphs" %>
