##### Homework due for today (Sept 24 2013)

1. PTPTours pilot team: meet as a team. *Sorry that this description is so long, I just want to give you detailed instructions!!*
	* Review and update your validation board with new or refined hypotheses. You are now getting more serious. I'd like to see meaningful set of hypotheses. You already have problem and customer hypotheses. Tighten them up.
	* You should also be clarifying more specifically who the customer is and where you could find one.You should now be working on solution hypotheses to try and validate. Essentially, what features do the customers want? Do they want a live tour guide or a recorded tour? Do they want a variety of types of tours, and if so, based on what? Expertise of the guide? Age of the guide? 
	* Take more steps to get out of the building and validate more hypotheses. You can use surveys, but also personal meetings, emails, facebook, searching through newsgroups and any of the other techniques we've discussed. 
	* <%= team_deliverable "Create a clean new Piazza post with your list of hypotheses in priority of importance, how you are validating them, and what you've learned so far. NOTE: Now that you now the validation board it is just up to you if you keep using it. You can decide if it is helpful to your process." %>
