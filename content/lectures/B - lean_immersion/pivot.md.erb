* Blog post in Piazza about your reactions and reflections on the Lean Startup technique. Please don't simply parrot what's in the book. Pause to think about what it has been to apply it so far. What are some key learnings? How would you explain it to a friend? What parts of it don't you think are valuable? <%= deliverable "Piazza post" %>
