### IT Entrepreneurship - Overview

This course will cover topics such as:

1. We will go in-depth on the "Lean Startup" model of entrepreneurship. This model is strongly focused on rapid iterations and validated learning. We will "go outside the building" to confirm (or refute) our hypotheses. A hypothesis in this context is a belief about the business we are consideringn starting up. A belief about a problem a user has, or a price they are willing to pay.

1. We will cycle twice through the Lean Startup process. 

	* First, during 4 weeks, we will rapidly learn the approach and terminology. While attacking a "pilot project" concept that I will supply (I hope you like it :). We will divide the class into two teams, and each one will work semi-independently on fleshing out the business plan. 

	* The second time through, students will apply the same process to the "term project". This is a product of their own conception. We will form 2-3 person teams, ideate, validate, design, and document a full business model for the product, up to and including an actual validated prototype.(By the way, the prototypes and business models are the starting point of the companion course, "Software Engineering for IT Entrepreneurs which I will be teaching in the Spring.")

#### Other topics

* We will learn and practice how to create static and working prototypes which are critical in the process of validated learning
* We will explore basic finance as it applies to startups, especially as it relates to Venture Capital and company financing, as well as pricing and sustainability.

#### Speaker Series

Every (other?) week there will be an invited speaker during class. These will be local entrepreneurs, CEOs and CTOs who will give their personal perspectives, insights and stories.

#### Requirements

This is a graduate level course (235A). The expectation is that you are an inventive and capable user of technology, brimming with ideas and inventions. I expect that you're comfortable learning new tools and techniques. 

We will not be doing much programming course per-se, but our focus in terms of topics and examples will be from the world of technology and computer startups. There will be a fair bit of writing and presenting.
