The Term Project forms the backbone of the second section of the term. Here is how it will work in general:

#### Term Projects

We will work in teams of 3 students. Students will form teams on their own, BUT I will have to bless final choices, because I sometimes will need to act as tie breaker or facilitator or something. Each team, by the end of the term, will have defined a new product or service, at least up to a point of being ready to seek funding. The content of the classroom work should be directly applicable to the project work.

The team has to come up with a validated business model for a product or service with the following characteristics:

* it should solve a problem we believe people really have
* we have evidence that people would pay money to solve it
* our solution involves technology of some sort
* we should have reason to believe that the product can be built

<%= bold_red "N.B: We are not actually going to create a product. We are going to develop the complete package of information that would justify further investment." %>

##### Objectives for each team

* Work as a team where everyone contributes. Figure out how you will be effective and make decisions.
* Post a weekly progress report for the team in Piazza
* Describe and flesh out an actual product or service that you want to build. 
* Follow a lean startup methodology to refine and test and describe the product in detail. 
* Articulate and build your MVP, pivot as needed
* Get out of the building and talk to real users and customers
* Prepare for a solid presentation of the product by the end of the semester
* Capture learnings along all the dimensions of the business model.
* Describe the details of the product as far as you can in a series of stories in Pivotal Tracker.

##### Ideation and team formation

As you know, ther first segment of the course we will be learning the Lean Startup model and applying it to the Pilot Project (P2PTours). During this same time we will be talking and making lists of possible products or services for the Incubator. Ideas are developed as follows:

* We develop a master list of one-sentence product or service ideas. I have a list of ideas too that we can use to prime the pump. We discuss, we brainstorm, we prioritize and we clarify.
* In class, we vote on our favorite two or three ideas. As a result of this process we clarify and add detail and also form up into teams of 3 students.
Preliminary product assessments
* Teams prepare a one page project brief to summarize their understanding and intentions for their product.  This requires further definition and some research for existing products that are relevant.
* The project briefs need to be approved by the instructor.

##### How to come up with a product idea and how to think about picking one

* Be hard-nosed! Don't go for what looks fun and cool ONLY
* Do a little research using your common sense:
* Can you find other similar products, competitors, or related products, and is this a good or bad thing?
* Look in Kickstarter and RocketHub. Are there any related projects?
* Do you believe that you could actually get enough funding through Kickstarter or RocketHub to build a prototype?
* What would the Sharktank say of it?
* How big a real problem is this really solving?
* For who, and do you think those people would be willing to pay for it?
* How would you get it to them?
* What kind of price do you think they would be willing to pay?
* Are you pretty sure this can be productized (that is, not can we make a single one by hand, but can we make a lot of them?)
