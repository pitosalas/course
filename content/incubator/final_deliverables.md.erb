title: Term Project Final Deliverables
section: incubator

##### Summary

This is a team, multi-part deliverable. You should start looking at this at the start of the Term Project part of the course so you know what you are working towards. It will account for a major part of your grade (see <%= link_to_background :grading %>)

Remember, 9 out of 10 startups fail. It is not expected that each project yields something that merits investment. The deliverables are designed to work with any possible outcome! Don't be scared by all the words below, I am just trying to be clear and detailed. Questions are welcome! 

##### Final Deliverable Part 1: Product Showcase

On <%= tbd %> we will have a Showcase where Outside Experts (tm) will have a chance to look and ask questions and give feedback on term project. Your job is to prepare for the Showcase, by creating a poster, a handout and being present at the showcase. Here's how it will work:

The Experts will ask to review the projects as if they were looking for angel funding. The review will not be based solely on what is on the poster and handout, but from conversation with you. They will assess and vote based on the idea itself, the business model, the degree and quality of thinking, the understanding of the market and the customer, all this based on getting outside the building, and of course how impressed they are with your ability to deliver. There will be a cool prize raffled among the top vote getters.

Your poster doesn't have to contain every detail of your project. Rather it should be an eye catcher that will get a visitor to come to you and learn more, ask questions and give you feedback. So think about the headline, the graphics, and the content in that context.

You should have a handout with the further details about your project to give out to people interested. One or two double sided sheet should be about right. This information will come right out of your second deliverable. I have attached two examples, but I don't expect yours to be like that, they are just to give you an idea.

On the last day of class, in class, we will have a dry run. All students will put up their posters and wander around to look at the other posters. There will be stacks of feedback forms for you to fill out on whatever posters interest you. Each team will collect the feedback sheets and collate them and share the feedback with the class.

##### Final Deliverable Part 2: Summary of results, plans for the future

Submit a detailed posting to <%= tbd %>. This is a Product Brief to a future you or someone else, when they are taking 236a and want to start building the product. Assume of course that the reader has not seen or heard any of the work you did before. Much/most of this content will come from your previous deliverables, including:

* elevator pitch and positioning
* target market and market size guestimates
* story of how the different hypotheses evolved, what MVP(s) you created and which ones were proven or not proved
* story of pivots done or contemplated
* all the ways in which you went 'outside the building'
* strategy for pricing and current thinking about the engine of growth
* Pivotal Tracker project with a strong list of initial stories
* subjective notes about your experience
* subjective notes about lessons learned

###### Alternative

If the team feels that their project in the end does not deserve to see the light of day in its current form you can do a variation of this deliverable.

It's a retrospective of your project. For this option, you should write an article/paper/post/report. You can choose whatever format you like: you might want to write an article intended for publication; you can write an extensive blog post; or you might create a standard college paper or report that you 'hand in'. In any event think of the length around 5-10 pages. The content should focus more on the process you went through, including for example:

* what your original goals were
* how you applied lean startup ideas
* how you assess the way your team spent the time. 
* did you pivot early enough?
* did you miss signals that could have allowed you to make a course correction?
* what parts of your original plan do you still believe in?
* is there a pivot you would undertake if you had more time?
* what are the lessons learned?
