title: Term Project Framework
section: incubator
order: 3
---
The purpose of the Term Project is to give you an open ended, but structured hands-on opportunity to:

* Apply the principles and concepts of lean startup and product discovery
* To think clearly about setting real goals for a product or business, whether they are to make lots of money or otherwise put a dent in the universe.
* To develop and practice the discipline to invest time and effort in only what is most important at any point

During the "Lean Immersion" period of the course everyone will be applying Lean Startup to a product idea that I have provided. The purpose is to do a practice round without the pressure of inventing a product.

Then, during the second part of the course you will pursue a Term Project that you conceive of following a defined framework, which will divide the work roughly into three frames of 3 weeks each. You should expect to pivot once or twice during that phase.

Challenge yourselves: We are looking for something with a potential big impact. A "big idea" that can perhaps change the world in some way. Not just a feature, but a product. 

Remember 9 out of 10 startups fail. If you're doing it right, you fail fast instead of spending months and years on something that's not gonna pan out. Our goal here is to improve those odds.

##### Frame 1 (3 weeks)

###### Deliverables:

* A concept for an exciting and impactful product or service with team alignment on exactly what the product **is** (this is harder than you think!)
* A name and one sentence summary for the product
* An "Elevator Pitch", value proposition and target market (with validation if possible)
* An initial solid set of hypotheses, in several categories. Prioritized. 
* Design and conduct out of the building 'experiments' to test hypotheses with multiple proven or disproven
* Pivotal Tracker or Trello project with stories being prioritized.
* An 8 minute presentation showing your progress and status. Structured feedback form is here: <%= link_to_incubator :frame_pres_feedback %>

##### Frame 2 (3 weeks)

###### Deliverables:

* A visual mockup or good paper prototype to use in further experiments and as input to the design. Also a diagram showing the flow of screen to screen in the user interface
* An architectural diagram of the product, site, app or service. An idea of how it could be built. What are the major building blocks or services.
* Database schemas on the server and/or client as needed to support your product. Communcation/REST protocol outline for your product. What jobs does the server do for the clients.
* Continued refinement of the stories explaining the functionality, and continued reflection on the hypotheses and whether more should be added and/or tested.
* Weekly "Status Update" post in Piazza, tagged "update"
* An 8 minute presentation showing your progress and status

##### Frame 3 (3 weeks)

###### Deliverables:

* A concept for the pricing of the product. This has its start in hypotheses that are tested.
* A revenue model that shows whether or not this product may lead to a sustainable business and how
* Explanation of the engine of growth
* An idea of the inital funding required to reach sustainability
* More hypotheses should be tested and more exposure to outside feedback.
* Stories being added to Pivotal Tracker
* A collection of 'user stories' which will form the basis for costing and building the product.
* Weekly "Status Update" post in Piazza, tagged "update"
* A 7 minute presentation showing your progress and status
