title: Term Project Framework
section: incubator
order: 3
---
The purpose of the Term Project is to give you an open ended, but structured hands-on opportunity to:

* Apply the principles and concepts of lean startup and product discovery
* To think clearly about setting real goals for a product or business, whether they are to make lots of money or otherwise put a dent in the universe.
* To develop and practice the discipline to invest time and effort in only what is most important at any point

During the "Lean Immersion" period of the course everyone will be applying Lean Startup to a product idea that I have provided. The purpose is to do a practice round without the pressure of inventing a product.

Then, during the second part of the course you will pursue a Term Project that you conceive of following a defined framework, which will divide the work roughly into three frames of 3 weeks each. You should expect to pivot once or twice during that phase.

Remember 9 out of 10 startups fail. If you're doing it right, you fail fast instead of spending months and years on something that's not gonna pan out. Our goal here is to improve those odds.

##### Frame 1 (3 weeks)

Deliverables:

* Team alignment on what the product or business or service is (this is harder than you think!)
* A name for the product
* One sentence summary of product
* An "Elevator Pitch" for the product
* A Validation board with testable hypotheses about the customer and the problem
* Initial Pivotal Tracker project with stories being prioritized
* Design and conduct 'experiments' to test hypotheses. Multiple hypotheses proven or disproven.
* Weekly "Status Update" post in Piazza, tagged "update"
* A 7 minute presentation showing your progress and status

##### Frame 2 (3 weeks)

Deliverables:

* A visual mockup or paper prototype to use in further experiments and as input to the design
* An architectural diagram of the product, site, app or service. An idea of how it could be built. A view of the cost in money and time of building the product and delivering the product.
* Continued refinement of the 'validation board'. More hypotheses should be tested and more exposure to outside feedback.
* Stories being added to Pivotal Tracker
* Weekly "Status Update" post in Piazza, tagged "update"
* A 7 minute presentation showing your progress and status

##### Frame 3 (3 weeks)

Deliverables:

* A concept for the pricing of the product. This has its start in hypotheses that are tested.
* A revenue model that shows whether or not this product may lead to a sustainable business and how
* Explanation of the engine of growth
* An idea of the inital funding required to reach sustainability
* Continued refinement of the validation board
* A collection of 'user stories' which will form the basis for costing and building the product.
* Weekly "Status Update" post in Piazza, tagged "update"
* A 7 minute presentation showing your progress and status
