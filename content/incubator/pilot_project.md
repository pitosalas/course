title: Pilot Project (P2P Tours)
section: incubator
order: 1
---
For the first 5 weeks of the course we will focused on the "Lean Startup" approach to validating a vision for a project, pivoting as necessary to achieve a product-market fit. We will divide students into groups of 5 or so, and each group will work independently to use the process on the vision for a product called "P2PTours"

This vision is purposely vague and allows many different implementations and instantiations.

##### P2PTours - Peer to Peer Tours

*"Our vision is that using just a cellphone, travelers can now get access to a huge and wonderful collection of locally recorded experts for free or for a nominal fee.*

*Imagine: you walk into St. Peter's Square and choose which local expert you want to listen to: a historian? A priest? An architect? A chef? Each one will have their unique perspective and will enhance your visit in their own unique way!*

##### Process

1. Class is divided into 5-student teams. You are a study group. You will work together to understand the ideas of Lean Startup and apply them to the Pilot Project.

1. There are 7 lectures over 4 weeks that will rapidly cover the approach and concepts. In that time you will read about half the book. 

1. I recommend that each pilot team arrange to meet at least 1-2 hours per week outside of class as a study group to learn from each other and work on group homeworks.

1. The pilot project will end with a class when each of the teams present their deliverables for the pilot project.

##### Team Deliverables

A presentation/discussion covering all the elements of the lean startup process including:

1. Hypotheses: is it a customer, problem or solution hypothesis? Any leap of faith? Which ones would you, did you or should you test first?
1. Building: Getting out of the building. Which hypotheses did you validate, what tools did you use, what were the results?
1. MVP: MVP What MVP did you create or would you create. How did you or would you use it to validate the hypotheses?
1. Pivots: What pivots do you anticipate and why? How would you handle them?
