Each product/service is required to complete a project brief and get instructors approval at the start of the first frame. This is to help assure consistency, good preparation, and a reasonable choice of product.

##### Required Sections
* A Tweet length (140 chars) summary of your project (product or service)
* On a scale of 1(low)-10(high) how personally excited are you about this?
* The three team members
* Your current intuition about your proposed project:
	* What is the problem is it solving? What is the "job" that your customer or user will hire this project to do for them?
	* What can you say about what who the customer is, where you can find them, where they congregate?
	* What form will your solution take, how will it work, what will it do? How will it be delivered to customers?
	* What are some ways in which it might make money? What other ways might it make a positive impact on people's lives or the world broadly speaking?
* What aspects of the product or the process are interesting and exciting to you?
