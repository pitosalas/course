##### Hypothesis Testing
* Getting out of the building
* You don't know anything!
* Show and Tell as appropriate
	* Do you need an MVP yet?
	* What's an MVP?
* Not just product questions: 
	* pricing
	* naming
	* problem statement
	* technology
* Some techniques
	* Google form/survey
	* LinkedIn groups
	* Find out who you know and who they know
	* Email to ask for a 20 minute phone call
	* Think about: where do they congregate?
	* Who are _they_?
* Target varies depending on the type of question!
