* Purpose of Quantitative Testing
	* "Prove" or "Disprove" a customer, problem or solution hypothesis
	* Hypothesis should be well stated!

* Techniques
	1. Online Survey
	1. Person to person conversations
	1. Mailing lists, facebook friends, etc.
	1. A/B Testing

* Designing a good online survey
	* How many questions?
	* Who do you send it to?
	* How many responses would be considered good?

* Proper protocols for talking to outsiders:
	* Don't flood university community with surveys, especially non-students
	* Make sure they know this is part of a course
	* Make sure they know you care and this is important to you
	* Be very respectful of outsiders' time. 30 minutes.
	* Always offer to come to them or make a phone call
	* Stick to the time
	* Be grateful and offer to return a favor
	* Give them my name and email in case they have any questions
	* Pito illustrates in Role playing
	* Role playing in pairs

* A/B Testing
	* Also known as "split testing"
	* Divide your targets into two (or more sets)
	* Show each of them an alternative version
	* Works best with a feature description, a marketing message, a price and so on.
	* <%= discussion "For each product team, what are some things that you could test using A/B? Exactly how would you go about it?" %>

* Qualitative testing
	* It's not all Prove/Disprove
	* Normal that during your contacts you learn unasked, quantitative information
	* Just because you were checking on a pricing hypothesis, don't ignore other things you learn that might inform your project.

* What's great about this approach?
	* No need to argue: I think this feature is better / You think that feature is better.
	* You've established channels and tools and pools of people to check with.
	* Just ask a few potential customers and see what they say!
