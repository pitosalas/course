title: Hypotheses

* *The LS notion of hypotheses*
	* Also 'assumptions', but I like the term hypothesis better because it emphasizes that we don't take a side as to whether it is true or not. We specifically want to generate evidence that will either prove or disprove it.
	*	Testable: You need to know how you would test it
	*	Explicit: You need to be able to state it succinctly (on a post-it note)
* Types of Hypothesis
	* Customer: Who is the customer? Where would you find them?
	* Problem: What is their pain? What is the 'job' they are 'hiring' a product to do?
	* Solution: What kind of solution are they seeking? What features do they need? Etc.
