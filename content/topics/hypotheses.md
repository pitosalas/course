##### Hypotheses
* The LS notion of hypotheses
	* Also 'assumptions', but I like the term hypothesis better because it emphasizes that we don't take a side as to whether it is true or not. We specifically want to generate evidence that will either prove or disprove it.
	* Testable: You need to know how you would test it
	* Explicit: You need to be able to state it succinctly (on a post-it note)
* Types of Hypothesis
	* According to the Validation Board
		* Customer: Who is the customer? Where would you find them?
		* Problem: What is their pain? What is the 'job' they are 'hiring' a product to do?
		* Solution: What kind of solution are they seeking? What features do they need? Will this solution actually address their problem?
	* But there are other kinds (LS book)
		* Growth Hypothesis - Use will grow over time.
		* Value Hypothesis - Like Solution Hypothesis
* Point is, don't get too hung up on classifications
* What is important is the idea of formulating testable hypotheses, running experiments, and updating your plans accordingly.
