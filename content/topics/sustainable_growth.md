##### Sustainable Growth

* Excludes one-time campaigns and actions
* Systematic: built into the product's usage
* Comes from actions of past and existing users or customers
* There are many ways in which using a product can drive revenue
	* Word Of Mouth (people recommend your product to others)
	* Side Effect of Usage (people see you using and want to use it too. Or in order to benefit you have to invite.)
	* In-product purchasses (part of the experience of the product requires you to spend money inside it.)
	* Subscription (or need to re-buy) (access charges, periodicals, expiration or consumption.)
	* Funded advertising (When advertising gets more users, and is funded from revenue from users.)
