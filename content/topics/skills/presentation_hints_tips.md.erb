#### Presentation Hints and tips

* Content of slides
	* Each presentation needs to be self-contained, in other words, you need to make sure it tells a story.
	* This includes an opening slide or two to set the context
	* And a closing slide or two drawing some comclusions.
	* Without that the presentation is not meaningful on its own.
	* Any diagrams, paper prototypes, and other illustrations need to be presented and explained so that the audience can understand and be engaged.
* Style
	* Rehearse/Practice!
	* A presentation is a kind of performance.
	* Be familiar with the material so you don't umm and mumm as if you are seeing the material for the first time.
	* Watch your pacing. Speak clearly and in complete sentences.
	* Keep to the time limit. Keep questions to the end. Work on the handoffs between the speakers to make them as smooth as possible.
	* Make sure your equipment works. Bring any connectors or other gadgets you will need.
	* Keep in mind that no one has seen this presentation before, and at least one person in the audience has never heard of your project. 
	* Watch your body language! Are you energetic, engaged? If you don't care, your listener will not either!
