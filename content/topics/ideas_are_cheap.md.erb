##### Ideas are cheap
* Everyone has a million ideas
* Few know how to turn the idea into a successful product or service
* Discussion: What is your definition of 'successful?'
* 90/10 Rule
* Don't be so secretive!
* (Almost) always gain more from sharing your idea and getting feedback
* vs. keeping it secret for imagined competitive advantage
* If your idea is so simple that a 10 minute description is enough to allow someone else to beat you.... then your idea wasn't really worth that much anyway!
