* I would like you to think back about your expectations and hopes about this course before you took it and what you know now. Write up a retrospective blog post thinking about questions such as:

	To what extent has it lived up to them? How do you feel you've changed your views on entrepreneurship and what it takes to be one? Do you see a role for yourself as an entrepreneur in the future? How has your thinking and approach about starting something brand new changed? What have I learned about myself as an entrepreneur? How have I grown? In what way do I feel better prepared now? In what way have I clarified what I want to do when I graduate?
