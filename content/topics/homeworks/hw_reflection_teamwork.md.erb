title: Reflection on team work
section: topics

* You have been working as a member of a small team. I would like you to reflect on that experience in writing. Here are some questions to ponder:

	How effective were you as a team member? Did you enjoy it? Sometimes peope on a team take on different roles by virtue simply of their personality and talents. What role did you take on? 

	Often in teams conflicts arise despite everyone's best intentions. Did any conflict arise in your team? Were you part of the problem or part of the solution? What did you learn about yourself during those difficult times?

	Overall what do you see as the importance of being an effective team member? What skills or talents do you bring to the table? Do you think it is something that one can learn to do better?
