title: Reflection on team work
section: topics

* You have been working as a member of a small team. I would like you to reflect on that experience in writing. Here are some questions to ponder:

	How effective were you as a team member? Did you enjoy it. Sometimes peope on a team take on different roles by virtue simply of their personality and talents. What role did you take on? 

	Often in teams conflicts arise despite everyone's best intentions. It's a safe assumption that everyone is doing the best job that they can but despite that teams can get into trouble. What kind of conflict arose in your team? How effective were you in handling that, and being part of the resolution? What did you learn about yourself during those difficult times? Can you see how you could handle things differently/better next time?

	Overall what do you see as the importance of being an effective team member? What skills or talents do you bring to the table? Do you think it is something that one can learn to do better?
