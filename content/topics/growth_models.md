##### Four example growht models (there are probably more)
* Sticky Engine of Growth
	* Comes from retention of existing custmers
	* Subscription model
	* Attrition, retention or churn rate: fraction of customers in period n who don't renew in period n+1
	* New customers in period(n+1) must exceed number who dropped it
	* Focus on either attracting more or getting the ones you have to renew
* Viral Engine of Growth
	* When your growth comes when simple normal use of the product inherently leads to new signups
	* "Vital Coefficient" - how many new customers a single customer brings in, and over what period
	* Viral coefficient should be > 1 to get exponential growth
* Paid Engine of Growth
	* When your growht depends on the simple ratio of customer acquisition cost vs. per customer earnings
	* Simply add more money to customer acquisition and you get a predictable amount of earnings from that.
	* LTV of a customer rells you how much you can spendn on customer acquisition.
