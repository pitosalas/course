* Pretty similar:
	* **Elevator Pitch**: externally focused - more of a sales tool to quickly latch onto someone's attention and make them want to know more.
	* **Positioning or Value Proposition**: more internally focused - a baseline from which other communication and strategy can be derived.
	* Read this (very short): [Positioning vs. Elevator Pitch]([http://www.slideshare.net/ArgentumStrat/positioning-vs-elevator-pitch)
	* Look at this site, which has elevator pitches galore: [Beta List](http://betali.st)
* Tips for Elevator Pitches
	* Put yourself in the listeners shoes, really!
	* Imagine that they say, "So What?" in response to each of your lines
	* If there's a very obvious objection, respond to it right away.
	* Hook them with the first words out of your mouth.
	* Purpose of an elevator pitch is to sell. To get the listener to say, "hmm, let's sit down so you can tell me more."
* Tips for Positioning/VP
	* Meant to clearly answer a series of key strategy questions
	* In a consise form, for internal use
	* Not for selling. For communicating and maintaining alignment
	* Try and be precise and clear

###### Breadcumbs is a product from a previous course that I taught:

> 	"To new residents of Boston, Breadcrumbs is a new kind of recommendation app that provides a focused, quick and entertaining recommendation for a destination of discovery and entertainment, because unlike Yelp and Facebook and similar sites, Breadcrumbs presents truly unique insider recommendations in a fun and focused smartphone app."

> 	"Do you know how when someone is new to a city or visiting it, it's hard to know the hotspots and the fun places to go? Or say you have 2 hours to kill while you wait for your flight? We're building a smartphone app which will give you a few focused recommendations based on where you are, what you want to do and how much time you have. We'll crowdsource recommendations, and have game mechanics to make it fun. We're not sure yet how we'll make money but we're thinking along the lines of coupons or sponsored recommendations. It will be designed as a platform so we can easily release it for other cities.
