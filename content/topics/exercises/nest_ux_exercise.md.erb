	* Break into 3 teams randomly and work on this for 10 minutes
	* Discuss and come up with a block diagram which reflects *all* the major elements of the architecture of the whole NEST system, not just the thermostat alone, and not just what is installed in the owner's home. Also draw lines between the elements that indicate how they talk to each other.
	* Present your findings to the class (3 minutes each team.)
