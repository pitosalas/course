##### Measuring the effect of a pivot
* Identify the key 'stages' that users experience on site
* Example: 
	* create account
	* log into account
	* add content
	* invite friend
* These are not arbitrary
	* they figure directly into your eventual business model
	* depending on your goals they will be different
	* depending on your stage they will be different
		* How many people responded to your email
		* answered your survey
		* etc.
* This becomes a classic "funnel" (sales, marketing etc.)
* Metrics... Metrics... Metrics
	* You also need a way to measure how many people make it to each step
	* Without metrics your pivots are a shot in the dark
* Once you have a baseline
	* Do the pivot
	* Quickly determine if you improved where you expected to improved
