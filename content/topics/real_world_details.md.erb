* Resumes
	* No need for permanent address 
	* Leadership and Activities is good, but try and have a special qualifications section, put that at very top! Why is that special? 
	* competitive advantage/ What makes you special? (professionally)
	* How will you benefit the Company?
	* Put details about activities/accomplishments, not just a title
	* add more detail about more important sections of resume
	* Have dates
	* People read resumes in "two seconds"; think of yourself as a product. 
	* Put skills etc. in priority order (what you know best goes first)
	* make sure skills good and important
	* One page resume rule
	* Older things generally less important
	* Personalize resume based on job/job type (within reason)
	* It is an ongoing process
	* Education section not necessary espec. high school
	* Color is OK! 
	* make sure black and white version of your colored resume looks just as good
	* Show, don't tell. Don't try and spend a whole page writing out your personality. You won't have any room for other things and it will be dificult to read 

* Career Objective
	* First sentence of resume state what you want from the job (Written in the frame of the reader)
	* Should be in cover letter as well
	* Make it consistent and relatively specific

* Phone Screens
	* Skill Based
	* pick out parts of resume, more description and detail about what you did
	* Know background of the company
	* have a question or two ready about the company
	* Try to be positive about the company, even if you have doubts, at least until you get a job offer
	* Make sure they are relevant
	* Know everything on your resume
	* review older projects

* Followups
	* Short thank you - sneek in something about wanting to talk more
	* Send a link or potentially more information that came up in your conversation
	* If you don't have the interviewer's contact info, email it to the contact you have and ask them to forward it
	* Feel free to followup on your followup
	* After two emails, don't continue
	* Don't expect a response from just a resume or even a phone screen. There should be one from an interview

* Portfolio
	* Showcases particular pieces of work you are proud of. Pictures, schematics, essays, videos, etc.
	* Have a project that you released into the "real" world
	* Something you had a major role in (can say it is your work)

* Types of Companies
	* Large company
		* fewer interactions outside of department (less personal)
		* more formality takes longer to get things done
		* Laden with process/politics/paperwork etc. 
		* Offers a ton of projects; Variety of passions/projects, more opportunities
		* can get laid off out of nowhere - less connection between you and your job security
		* Less scrutiny on each individual employee
		* Structure
	* Small companies
		* Get involved in a lot of projects very easily = more impact 
		* No process, take initiative to get things done (fix your own problems)
		* very focused; Lives & breathes the one project - not good if you want to experience more than one type of thing
		* Earlier in your life, it is easier to take risk
		* No room/limited room for mistakes (Spotlight)
		* Easy access to higher-ups
		* Company depends more on you
		* A whole buncha fun, all of the time
		* Conversely, a whole buncha work, all of the time
		* "How funded are you guys?" or CrunchBase (http://www.crunchbase.com/)
	* Differences: more beaurocracy and processes in large companies, whereas small companies demand more self-reliance and are more focused
	* Don't assume that any job will be secure/last forever
	* Can be a financial issue but also means that you aren't stuck in a job for life
	* find out about the runway for startups
	* May be easier to get a job if willing to move to an area with fewer people with your skill set
 
* Lifestyle Business 
	* Doesn't grow (not designed to grow exponentially) 
	* Gives a decent, liveable salary--supports the lifestyle its employees want to maintain
	* The lack of prospective growth can hurt the attitude of employees (cause lack of motivation)
 
* Contractor vs. Consultant
	* Mostly the same, self employed and not working directly as an employee; more of how you want to position yourself
	* Implication of contractor - do a lot of work quickly for the compnay
	* Consultant- more of an advising position 
	* Consultant would work with the company, contractor for it.

* Taxes and Benefits
	* Some companies withhold taxes automatically
	* 401K- deposits are not taxed
	* Some companies match a portion of salary 
	* 5% match - they will match up to 5% of your income

* Stock purchase plan
	* vesting - you can buy stock but you cannot get it unless you work at the company for x amount of time
	* Significance of each benefit depends on person
