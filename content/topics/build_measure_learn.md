##### Build/Measure/Learn
* Startup needs to:
	1. State what metrics for growth and success are
	1. Measure current metrics
	1. Conduct Experiments to try and move reality towards goals
	1. Rinse and repeat.
* AKA: "Iterating"
* Key question: are you making your product better?
	* How do you know?
	* Are the changes you are making affecting the measures you care about?
	* How do you decide what measures you care about?
* Back to first principle: "Is this a business or a hobby?"
* Basic pattern:
	* Use an MVP to get real data to test a belief
	* Make a series of micro changes (parallel or serial)
	* Measure whether metrics are better or worse
	* When you feel like you are not making real progress
	* Perhaps pivot if micro changes are not moving the needle in the right direction
* Start with the highest return (cost/risk/reward) assumption
