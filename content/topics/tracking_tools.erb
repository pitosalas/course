* Why are we learning about these now?

##### Stories

* byte sized 'tasks' which are kept in priority order
* called stories because they typically describe a story about a user
* Developers work in cycles or iterations or sprints
* Can be between 1 and 4 weeks each
* Between sprints, story ordering can change to reflect latest view of priority
* Most important story to do NOW is on top
