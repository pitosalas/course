* You can't manage what you don't measure. What gets measured gets managed

* Useful Metrics are
	* Actionable:
		* You can use them to figure out what to do, or what you did, to cause the change. 
		* Need to know what to do to get more of that result
	* Transparent: Publish metrics to the team
	* Accessible: Make the definition of what's being measured clear. No made up words or jargon.
	* Auditable: Make it easy to see the underlying raw data
* But, beware of 'vanity metrics!'
	* More users today than yesterday? Not enough.
	* How do I change it. What changes will affect what metrics?
	* You can make changes, but will they matter to customers?
