##### Background of the Business Model Canvas

* One way to sructure strategic planning, analysis
* Checklist helps cover all the bases when designing a business model
* Handy if have one of several possibilities that you are examining
* Note that a single business might operate based on two different models (but it's more complex to do that and usually not the right way to go.)

##### Building Blocks of a business model

* Value Proposition (the offer)
    * What problem do we solve for the customer?
    * What product/service do we deliver to the customer?
    * How do we do that compared to what they do today?
    * Totally new? Faster? More customized? Not solved before? Elegant design? Better price? Brand/Status? etc.
* Customer Segments 
    * What customer or groups of customers? And who are the most important ones?
    * What makes a distinct segment? A different offer? Different channels? Different types of relationshops? Different payment models
    * Examples: Mass market? Niche market? Segment of larger market? Two sided market?
    * Note that you might be going after more than one!
* Revenue Streams (or pricing model)
    * Per customer segment/offer, who pays and what do they pay for?
    * Examples: simple purchase; usage fee ("pay by the drink"); subscription; licensing
* Channels
    * How do you reach a customer? How do they want to be reached?
    * Are you able to reach them in that way?
    * Evaluate: generate awareness, allow evaluation, enable purchase, delivery, after sales follow up?
    * Examples: Web site, Direct Sales, Reseller web site (e.g. Amazon), Stores, Wholesaler.
* Customer Relationships
    * What kind of ongoing relationship does your customer want with you?
    * Examples: personal email; self-service support site; face-to-face; online community; co-creation
* (Key) Resources
    * Go a level deeper than just "money". Identify all the things you will need
    * For example: expertise (we need a bigdata person), IP (we need to license music), physical (we will need a shop floor to do assembly.)
* (Key) Activities
    * This might seem obvious but it's worth calling out, because it's so 'obvious'
    * Examples: software development; packaging and shipping; manufacturing; support; marketing; manufacturing; licensing; etc.
* (Key) Partnerships
    * What outside entities do you have to establish trust with for your model to work?
    * Suppliers? Resellers? Distributors? Maybe a web distributor like Amazon? Maybe Apple, because they have to approve your app. Are you licensing something from a partner?
* Cost Structure
    * 'Simply' all the costs needed to run the businss model
    * Fixed costs, per-unit variable costs, per-employee variable costs
    * Based on Key resources, key activities and key partnerships
