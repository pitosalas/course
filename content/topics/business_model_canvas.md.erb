###### Building Blocks of a business model
* Value Proposition
    * What problem do we solve for the customer?
    * What product/service do we deliver to the customer?
    * How do we do that compared to what they do today?
    * Totally new? Faster? More customized? Not solved before? Elegant design? Better price? Brand/Status? etc.
* Customer Segments
    * What customer or groups of customers?
    * Who are the most important customers?
    * What makes a distinct segment?
        * Require a different offer
        * Reached through different distribution channels
       * Require different kinds of relationships
        * Willing to pay for different aspects of the offer
