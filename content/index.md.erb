COSI 235a this fall has been fully updated so I hope you read through the following to get a feel for what this program is about. You can think of 235a as part one of a two part cycle. Part one: Idea -> Validated business model. Part two (236b) Validated business model to launch.

__We want to take an idea__, let's say a 'good idea', (see <%= link_to_topic :ideas_are_cheap %>) to fruition as a business that has a real chance to make real money and/or have an big imact on a many real people's lives. Not a hobby that you pursue because you'd like to learn and grow (which is fine) but something that you have real reason to believe will make a big difference. It is said that 9 out of 10 startups fail. Our goal is to improve your odds. 

__This is not a software engineering course.__ It is a course that helps you develop the discipline and tools to develop your idea and to assure that it will meet its goals - like making money and/or having an actual real impact on the world. 

I use the line "is this a hobby or a business." For this course I am not interested in doing a project because it's fun or you get to learn how to use rails or javascript. Those are personal goals which are fine but will not effect a change in the world. 

__Open to undergraduates with permission of instructor.__ This is a graduate level course. If you are an undergrad, to request permission, send me an email request at pitosalas@brandies.edu including your take on assignment two of the first homework. (You can find the first day's lecture and homeworks here: <%= link_to_lecture :welcome %>)
