* The homework due for a particular lecture is always listed at the top of the page for that day. It is due before class on that day. Talk to us if that poses a problem.
* Some homework is designated "Team Deliverable:" which means that a single deliverable is due for the team and all team members get credit for it.

##### Handing in Homework
* Deadline for handing in homework is basically when the class starts. 
* If you need an exception you need to communicate with Yao (see <%= link_to_background :teachers %>) first. We will be reasonable.
* If you need to update a submission for some reason, check with Yao (see <%= link_to_background :teachers %>) first. He will coordinate.

##### Piazza
* You will have received an account on Piazza
* Individual blog Post homework is submitted as a posted "note" on piazza with a "homework" tag.
* Each team is required to write a brief product update every week. These are piazza "notes" with a "project update" tag.

##### Google Drive
* I will create a google drive folder and invite all students into it. 
* Deliverables that are presentations or spreadsheets should be done in Google Docs and moved into the class google drive folder.

<%= important "protocol for using the google drive" %>

* Create a folder for your stuff named with your name or your teams name
* Drop your deliverable as appropriate into the right folder.
* Name it according to this schema: PART-CLASS-HWK
	* PART: according to master schedule, A,B,C,D,E,F
	* CLASS: Class number
	* HWK: Homework number
* So for example: B-2-1 for the second lecture during "B - Lean Immersion", homework one.
