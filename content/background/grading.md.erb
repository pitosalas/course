We (<%= link_to_background :teachers %>) will be using Latte to collect assessments which build up into your grade. You can talk to either of us about what you see there and whether we've missed a homework or whatever. You will notice that even though this is a 100 point scale, there is an extra credit section that gives you a possibility of as much as 115 points!

1. Class Participation (up to 20 points): This includes basic things like being in class when it starts, participating in the discussion, speaking up and contributing to the overall success of the course. It also means being prepared with the assigned readings so you know what it was about and have follow up questions. Sometimes the reading might confuse you initially, but then you bring good discussion questions to class.

1. Pilot Project (up to 20 points): This will be a 5 person team grade. The measure will be how well each of the key concepts of Lean Startup are understood, how good a job the team does with conceptualizing and realizing the lean startup approach. These are new concepts and all students are working on the same product concept. We are looking more for your understanding of the material and pragmatic application of it as evidenced in your presentations and final presentation.

1. Term Project(up to 40 points): This will be a term project team grade (3 people). We are looking at how well team members applied the Lean Startup techiniques and other concepts we covered to your product or service work. How well did you listen to feedback from prospects, experts and incorporate those ideas into your project. How good were your interim presentations? Did you make steady progress or cram everything into the end? How good was your two final deliverables? What kind of feedback did you receive during the product showcase?

4. Writing and Blogging (up to 20 points): Throughout the course there will be writing and blogging assignments. THe goal of these assignments is to allow you to show your understanding of what we are learning, and also especially to show that you are thinking critically and strategically about the materials.

5. Extra Credit (up to 15 points): There is up to a 15% possible bonus that you can use to compensate or add to your metrics if you want to put in some extra work. We will inform you as the term progresses of opportunities for this, and they will be listed here too.

	* Create a Kickstarter or HubRocket (or other) crowdsource campaign for your term project. It is up to you whether you submit it or not. If you do this, be serious about it and do a great job. A video is required. (up to 5 points)
	* Read one of the articles from <%= link_to_background :links %> and write a thoughtful post about it, where you don't just summarize or parrot it back, but give a unique insight, challenge, controversy, or case study inspired by the article (1 point each, up to possible 3 points)
