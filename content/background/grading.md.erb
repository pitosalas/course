We (<%= link_to_background :teachers %>) will be using Latte to collect assessments which build up into your grade. You can talk to either of us about what you see there and whether we've missed a homework or whatever. 

You will notice that even though this is a 100 point scale, there is an extra credit section that gives you a possibility of as much as 115 points!

###### Grading Calculations

##### Notes and comments

* Class participation includes basic things like being in class when it starts, participating in the discussion, speaking up and contributing to the overall success of the course. It also means being prepared with the assigned readings so you know what it was about and have follow up questions. Sometimes the reading might confuse you initially, but then you bring good discussion questions to class.

##### Team work

* For team deliverables each student on the team will get the same score on each item. A student will likely be on a different team for the pilot vs. the term project but in any event, each member of the team gets the same score on each team deliverable.

* Every team member is expected to work on the deliverable, in some capacity, to some extent. I don't expect you to take turns typing on the keyboard, just so there's reasonable sharing of contribution.

* In my experience, on rare occassions, one member of the team becomes a bystander while others do the work, or one member takes over and does almost all the work. This is not the idea, so I might confidentially ask students their view of how well the team is functioning.

* Extra work can yield as much as 15 extra points. Thisis a possible bonus that you can use to compensate or add to your metrics if you want to put in some extra work. We will inform you as the term progresses of opportunities for this, and they will be listed here too.

	* Create a Kickstarter or HubRocket (or other) crowdsource campaign for your term project. It is up to you whether you submit it or not. If you do this, be serious about it and do a great job. A video is required. (up to 5 points)
	* Read one of the articles from <%= link_to_background :links %> and write a thoughtful post about it, where you don't just summarize or parrot it back, but give a unique insight, challenge, controversy, or case study inspired by the article (1 point each, up to possible 3 points)
