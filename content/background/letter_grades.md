order: 5

At the middle and end of the term you will receive letter grades. It's important to remember that a "B" is a totally reasonable grade (everyone always seems to forget this!) 

To help with that, here's a brief summary of how I think about each grade:

* "A" student:
	* CP: Participates actively in class, without dominating the discussion. Makes illuminating remarks, asks questions of teacher and other students that lead to deeper insights. Listens to others and responds appropriately and respectfully.
	* TW: In a team, is seen as key to the success of the team. Helps keep team momentum. Acts as a leader. Makes sure team meetings are productive.ative)
	* WW: Blog and other written work is insightful, thoughtful, well written, often linking with other closely related resources. Code examples are clean and well-commented, illustrating clever algorithms clearly described and coded.
	* IN: Doesn't let obstacles get in the way, creatively and effectively searches for solutions and shares with the class
	* PP: Is always present when class begins, well prepared, and completes all of the homework assignments on time

* "B" student:
	* CP: participates in class, sometimes needs to be asked to contribute
	* TW: In a team will deliver on commitments made, but but doesn't take responsibility for making sure the group projects gets completed well, doesn't act as a leader.
	* WW: Blog and other written work is clear but rarely deep and insightful and doesn't make bigger connections. Could use a more strategic perspective. Code examples work correctly but are not elegant and beautifully commented.
	* IN: Often uses own resourcefulness to overcome obstacles, but may need to be prodded.
	* PP: Usually is present and prepared, completes homework generally completed on time.

* "C" student:
	* CP: For the most part only participates if asked by a teacher. Asks questions that are off-topic or display lack of attention the discussion. Distracts the class.
	* TW: Does not reliably complete work on group projects, blames others. Is not seen as a contributor to the team and other team members notice this.
	* WW: Class presentations of homework are somewhat confusing. Blog posts are poorly written or miss the point of the article. Code examples often have bugs and/or are poorly commented.
	* IN: Needs a lot of handholding to overcome obstacles for which solutions are readily available
	* PP: Is often late, or not attending to what's going on in class. Homeworks are often late

* "D" student:
	* We'll let you know if you are performing at a D or lower level!!!
